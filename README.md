# Fractal Code 2.0: Implosion Overview

Fractal Code 2.0 is a revolutionary data compression paradigm based on symbolic fractal folding and differential mutation encoding.

Unlike traditional compression methods, Fractal Code 2.0 achieves **over 99% data size reduction** through fractal implosion principles — not linear entropy reduction.  
It enables extreme data compaction while preserving 100% information integrity and full reversibility.

## Key Results:
- **Original size:** 1 MB
- **Compressed size:** ~5.3 KB
- **Compression ratio:** ~0.52%
- **Data recovery:** 100% lossless

This repository provides an overview of the Fractal Code 2.0 concept and its initial results.  
**Technical implementation details are confidential and not disclosed here.**
